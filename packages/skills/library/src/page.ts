// The library's pages, the user's own view of it on any device, served by AnythingLLM from its
// public folder (#shared/pages):
// - The Vault's keys section (#shared/vault-page, the page every skill that keeps secrets shares):
//   the API keys and signing keys by name, never their values. The user adds a key there, sealed on
//   their device with the vault's public key, and deletes one; makes a signing key or imports its
//   seed, sealed the same way (signing.ts). It's a second place to give a key, beside the skill's own
//   settings (slot.ts): the agent asks, the need shows at the top of Keys, and the user may enter it
//   there.
// - The Library page (static/pages/library.html): the targets (machines the functions run commands
//   on over SSH; the user registers one there, with a key pasted or made, sealed on their device
//   with the vault's public key), the toolkits, their functions' sources and the recent runs; the
//   user deletes a function, a toolkit or a target there.
// What the user does is applied at once while a page is open, and at the start of the agent's next
// call; library then shows it (a key saved, a target tried).
//
// The Library page's address holds a random token, and each event it posts carries a secret:
// anyone with the link can read what it shows and act on it, so it's shared as a signed-in session
// would be, and rotated (a new token and secret) from the page. The Vault has names of its own.
//
// The owner can keep the Library page's and the Vault's links from the agent (#shared/page-links:
// `anywherellm-suite pages --hide`). Names made while that switch was off, or before it existed,
// may have been given to the agent, so the first time the page is shown after the switch goes on
// they are replaced once (settle), and the page's names are marked `hidden`. Either way the page's
// path is kept in the links file, for whoever shows it to the user.
