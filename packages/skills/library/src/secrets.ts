// in the library's own settings (slot.ts), or on the Vault (page.ts), sealed on their device; not on
// AnythingLLM's question card, which shows its answers in the chat. A secret goes with a request only to its own site (or a site under
// it), only over https (or plain http to a host the user lets through), put where the API wants it
// (as a bearer token, by HTTP Basic, in a header or in the query), and at most PER_MINUTE times a
// minute from one process (a scheduled job's child process counts its own).
