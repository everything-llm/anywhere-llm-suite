// The user's own library of API toolkits, as one agent skill: for each service, what the agent
// learned of its API (store.ts), the keys it calls with (secrets.ts, kept in the vault, which the
// model never reads), the machines it runs commands on (targets.ts, in the vault too) and small
// JavaScript functions it wrote, run in QuickJS (sandbox.ts, runs.ts).
// One library for the whole AnythingLLM, kept in its storage (<storage>/library-lean/), so every
// workspace and every scheduled job shares it. What is tuned rather than coded (the guide, the
// snippets, the prelude every function runs after, the pages) is in static/, which the user can
// override file by file on their instance. The user gives a key in the skill's own settings (slot.ts).
// Its two pages (page.ts) are the user's own view of it: the Vault, every secret by name, where they
// can give a key too, and the Library page, the toolkits and their runs.
//
// esbuild bundles this into the one handler.js AnythingLLM loads.
