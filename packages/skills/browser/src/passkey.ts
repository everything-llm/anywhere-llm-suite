// Passkeys, a kind of saved login. Every chat's tab has a virtual authenticator, Chrome's software
// passkey store reached through the DevTools Protocol's WebAuthn domain, holding the saved passkeys:
// a site's passkey sign-in then works for the agent as a saved password does, and Chrome itself
// keeps each passkey to its own site. A tab without one would hang when a site asks for a passkey,
// since headless Chrome has no dialog to show.
//
// A passkey a site makes while the user holds the tab is offered to them for saving, as a typed
// password is; one made while the agent has it is taken out again, so only the user adds passkeys.
// After a sign-in the passkey's signature count is kept, and given to the other tabs, so it never
// goes back. Ported from the lean browser's passkey.js.
