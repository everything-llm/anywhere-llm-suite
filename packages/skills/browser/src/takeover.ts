// The user taking a tab over on its page: they take it (take) and hand it back (give); while they
// hold it they tap, scroll, type and go back or reload, and the agent reads but doesn't act. What
// they type is hidden from the agent like a login, and a password comes sealed with the vault's
// public key. After they sign in, the page offers to save the login, and a passkey a site makes
// while they hold the tab is offered the same way (passkey.ts). The page also says how much room it
// has (size), and the tab's screen follows it, so the tab fills a phone or a desktop window.
//
// A tab the user opened themselves is held by them for good: its page types, taps and goes back
// as on a chat's tab they took over, but it's never handed to the agent, and its hold doesn't lapse.
//
// The events come through page.ts, checked against the tab's secret. Ported from the lean
// browser's takeover.js.
