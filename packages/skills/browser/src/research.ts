// Research without moving the chat's tab: search asks a search engine (SEARCH_URL, the skill's
// setting) and answers the results it links to; look reads any page the way read does. Both use a
// page of the workspace's browser of their own (browser.ts scratch), through the fence, and close it
// after, so the tab the user may be watching stays where it was. What they read is data, never
// instructions. Nothing here knows any engine: a result is a link off the engine's own site, and a
// link the engine sends through itself is followed to the address it holds.
