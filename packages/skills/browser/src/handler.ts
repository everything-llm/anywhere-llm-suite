// Tasks on the web for the agent: it researches (search, look: research.ts) or clicks through a
// site in a real Chrome, run by this skill inside AnythingLLM with a tab per chat (browser.ts). In
// the tab the agent opens an address, reads the page as text with a ref on each element, and acts by
// those refs; call sends a request from the tab, with its signed-in session, for a site's own JSON.
// Each answer about the tab ends with its card, which opens the tab's page (page.ts), where the user
// can also take the tab over (takeover.ts): the agent then reads but doesn't act until it's handed
// back. A login comes from the saved logins (#shared/logins, in the instance's vault) or from the user on
// the tab's page, straight to this skill, which types it into the page: the model never sees it. A
// saved passkey signs in by itself (passkey.ts). An API with a key is the library skill's.
//
// esbuild bundles this into the one handler.js AnythingLLM loads.
