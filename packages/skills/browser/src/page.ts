// A tab's card and its page. After each step the tab's picture is taken and written into
// AnythingLLM's public folder (public/browser-lean/, served to any browser), with a small state file
// beside it (its title and address, what the agent asks the user for, where the Vault is) and
// the tab's page (static/pages/tab.html), all under a random name kept for the chat's tab. The card
// the agent puts in its reply is a crop of the picture that opens the page.
//
// The page is where the user gives what only they may know: a login or a code the agent asked for,
// sealed on their device with the vault's public key, posted through AnythingLLM's browser-extension
// upload (#shared/pages), checked against the tab's secret and typed into the tab here; never on
// AnythingLLM's question card, which shows its answers in the chat. There they also take the tab
// over to use it themselves (takeover.ts) and save what it offers. The saved logins are listed and
// deleted on the Vault (#shared/vault-page), whose logins section this skill writes and applies,
// and which the tab's page links to, unless the links are kept from the agent (#shared/page-links).
// Events are applied as they come while a page was shown lately, and at the start of each call.
