// The apps manager: one page for every workspace's apps (static/pages/manager.html), the user's own
// view of them on any device, which AnywhereLLM Lite opens from its Apps row. Each app shows its
// card's summary, its page, its newest changes and its earlier app.json and page.html; the user
// renames one (its title), takes back its newest change, puts back an earlier file, moves it to the
// trash, and restores one from there. What the user does is posted as an event under the manager's
// own title and applied at once while AnythingLLM's process watches, else at the skill's next call.
//
// Its address holds a random token and each event it posts carries a secret, as the Library page's
// do (#shared/token-page): anyone with the link can see what it shows and act on it, so it is
// rotated (a new token and secret) from the page. It shares apps-lean/ in the public folder with the
// apps' own pages, so its files are manager-<token>.html and .json, a shape no app page has. Its
// path is kept in the links file as `apps`, which the bridge hands to Lite; while the links are kept
// from the agent (#shared/page-links), the agent isn't told it.
