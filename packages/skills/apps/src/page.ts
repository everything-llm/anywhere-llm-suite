// change, so its link always shows the app as it is (#shared/pages). It has no server to save to,
// so each change is posted to AnythingLLM as an event document with the browser-extension key
// install keeps for the pages (--page-key), which can only store documents; the skill takes the events from where
// AnythingLLM's collector writes them and applies each through the same schema check as any change.
// A change shows at once on the page and stays applied over newer data until the app records it
