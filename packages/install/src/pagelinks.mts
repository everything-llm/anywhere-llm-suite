// The two things install keeps about the Library, Vault and apps manager pages' links (shared/page-links.mts is the
// skills' side): the switch that keeps them from the agent, a file the owner makes and removes here
// (it is the owner's file, but code that runs in the container can write the storage, so it is a
// guard against the model, not against everything that runs beside it), and the links file the skills
// keep, which holds the pages' root-relative paths and, per page, when its link was last replaced.
// Nothing here reads a page's own state (page.json, vault-page.json): those hold the secrets, and the
// links file exists so that nobody needs to.
