// Which machine is this one: a target that is this machine, or answers from an address of it, signs
// the agent in as an account here, which reads what AnythingLLM keeps beside it (the vault's key, the
// pages' secrets). So the library refuses these however the user ticked the target, and checks the
// address the connection is made to, not only the name. Three things say "this machine":
//
//   - loopback, link-local and unspecified addresses, and every address of every interface this
//     process sees. Inside a container that list is the container's (a pasta container shows lo and
//     the LAN, not the host's tailnet address), so
//   - the install on the host records the host's own addresses and the fingerprints of its SSH host
//     keys in <storage>/anywherellm-suite/this-host.json (packages/install/src/thishost.mts), and
//     both are refused too: a machine that shows one of the host's keys is the host, whatever address
//     it was reached at.
//
// That file is written by the installer, on the host, and only read here. A host that was never
// (re)installed has none: kit.ssh then refuses every target (thisHostUsable), since it can't tell.
//
// One exception, the owner's: the record may name accounts on this host the owner vouches for
// (`allow`: login and port, written by `anywherellm-suite this-host --allow login@port`). A target
// that is this machine by its address or its host key is let through only when its login and port
// are exactly one of those (thisHostAllows); every other login or port here stays refused. It is for
// a separate unprivileged account that can't read AnythingLLM's storage (a home of its own at 0700,
// processes hidden from it, a firewall keeping it to its own ports), such as an sshd on another port
// of the VM AnythingLLM runs in. The record lives in AnythingLLM's storage, which code in the
// container can write, so `allow` is an owner switch about which accounts the owner vouches for,
// like page-links-hidden, not a lock against code inside the container: nothing the skills do writes
// it, and only the installer does.
// A test that stands a machine up on 127.0.0.1 names it in THISHOST_EXCEPT (a Set on globalThis), and
// a test can give the record in THISHOST_RECORD; nothing shipped sets either.
