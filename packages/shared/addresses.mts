// The Vault's Allowed addresses section (#shared/vault-page): the origins on this machine or its
// network the user lets the skills reach (allowed.json, which the fence reads), and the ones the
// fence refused lately (refused.json, fence.mts noteRefused), each with an Allow button, and a field
// to type one. Every skill that shows the Vault writes and applies it (pages.take claims each event
// once), so it works with the browser alone or the library alone.
//
// An origin is let through only when it's on this machine or its network: a public one needs
// nothing, and plain http to it would carry a key (fence.mts secureFor). Never a loopback address, on
// any port: inside AnythingLLM's container that is the container itself (its server, its collector),
// and on Desktop the machine has a name on its network. Never one of the suite's own services
// either: AnythingLLM's address (ANYTHINGLLM_URL), or this machine's own addresses
// (#shared/thishost: its interfaces', and those the installer recorded) on OWN_PORTS or AnythingLLM's
// port. What can't be told (a name that can't be looked up; neither the record nor AnythingLLM's
// address) is refused, and the page says why.
