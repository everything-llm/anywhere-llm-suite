// Whether the Library, Vault and apps manager pages' links are kept from the agent, and where the user finds them
// then. The switch is a file in the suite's folder of the storage, `page-links-hidden`, which the
// owner makes and removes on the host (`anywherellm-suite pages --hide` / `--show`). It is the
// owner's file, but code that runs in the container can write it, so it is a switch for what the
// skills tell the agent, not a lock against the agent's own tools. With it present the skills still write their pages, but their answers carry no
// link to the Library page, the Vault or the apps manager. The links file, `page-links.json`, holds the paths for
// whoever may show them to the user (the bridge, `anywherellm-suite pages`): it is written whether
// the switch is on or off, and each skill owns its own key; `rotated` says when each page's token was
// last replaced by a rotation (so `pages` can tell which link is new). For AnywhereLLM Lite's shelf it
// also holds the browser's open tabs (`browser`) and the Library's and the apps' status (`status`):
// paths, numbers and times only, which the bridge passes on. It holds no event secret and no page key,
// but a path in it is a bearer capability (whoever fetches the page gets the secret its HTML
// embeds), so it is kept like the page key: 0600, never logged.
