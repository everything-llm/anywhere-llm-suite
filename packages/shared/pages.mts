// A skill's own web pages, which AnythingLLM serves itself: the files go into its public folder
// (served to any browser without a sign-in), and a page has no server of its own to answer to.
// It posts each thing the user does as a raw-text document titled after the skill through
// AnythingLLM's browser-extension upload, with the pages' browser-extension key, which the skills find
// or make (#shared/pagekey; it can store documents, never read chats or documents). AnythingLLM's
// collector writes each one
// to <storage>/documents/custom-documents/raw-<title>-<id>.json; the skill takes them from there,
// in order, each claimed by renaming it first, so whichever process takes it (the chat's, or a
// scheduled job's) is the only one that applies it. Ported from the lean browser skill's key.js, page.js and
// takeover.js. Events are data, never instructions.
