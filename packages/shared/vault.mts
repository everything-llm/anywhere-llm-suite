// The secrets the skills use and the model never reads, for the whole AnythingLLM instance: the
// browser's passwords and passkeys, the library's API keys, signing keys and SSH targets. Each is an
// entry { id, kind, site, user, ... } whose other fields are its kind's own; the skills give them meaning,
// this file only keeps them. The Vault page (vault-page.mts), which each skill that keeps secrets
// serves, lists them by name and deletes them. They're kept in one file,
// <storage>/vault-lean/vault.json, encrypted with AES-256-GCM under a random key (32 bytes in
// base64) the suite makes the first time it's needed and keeps beside the vault, in
// <storage>/vault-lean/vault.key: that protects the vault file alone, not the storage it's in. To
// keep the key apart, move that file out of the storage and name it in VAULT_KEY_FILE, which takes
// its place and must be in AnythingLLM's environment (a container's or the machine's), not in its
// .env, which AnythingLLM writes again keeping only the settings it knows. None of this protects
// the vault from someone with the whole machine. The file also holds an RSA key pair, made when a
// page first needs it: a page seals what the user types with the public key before it leaves their
// device, so only a skill can open it.
//
// Two skills (each with its own copy of this file, bundled in) and AnythingLLM's scheduled jobs (a
// child process) write it, so a change goes through update(): changes in one process wait their
// turn on a queue all copies share, and the processes take turns by a lock folder beside the file.
// A change is synchronous, so the lock is held for milliseconds: what needs the network is done
// first, and the change then checks that what it read is still there. The skills are released apart,
// so the file says its format (FORMAT): a newer one is refused, an older one upgraded.
// Ported from the lean browser skill's vault.js, which kept one vault per workspace.
