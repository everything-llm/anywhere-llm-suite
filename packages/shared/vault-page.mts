// The Vault: one page where the user sees every secret the instance's vault keeps, by name and
// never by value, and deletes it: the browser's logins and passkeys, the library's API keys and
// signing keys; and the addresses on their network they let the skills reach
// (addresses.mts). Each skill that keeps secrets bundles this module and serves the page itself, so
// either skill works installed alone; installed together, they serve the same page.
//
// The page (vault.html) lives under one random name in AnythingLLM's public folder
// (public/vault-lean/<token>.html), kept with the secret its events carry beside the vault
// (vault-lean/vault-page.json). Each skill writes only its own section's state beside it
// (<token>-logins.json, <token>-keys.json) and the addresses section's (<token>-addresses.json),
// nothing secret, and the page shows a tab for each section it finds: a skill installed alone shows
// its own. What the user does in a section is posted under that
// section's title (vault-lean-logins, vault-lean-keys, vault-lean-addresses) and applied by the
// skill that owns it (either, for the addresses), as its events come while the page was shown
// lately, and at the start of its calls.
//
// A skill shipping an older page doesn't write over a newer one another skill wrote (VERSION).
//
// With the switch on (#shared/page-links) the skills give the agent no link to the page. A page made
// before that, or while the switch was off, may have been given to it, so the first show after the
// switch goes on replaces the page's name and secret once (settle); the names carry a mark for it.
// Whatever the switch, show and rotate keep the page's path in the links file for whoever shows it
// to the user.
