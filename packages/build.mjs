// Builds the JavaScript parts with esbuild. Each part becomes one file that needs nothing installed
// beside it, and the build fails (removing the output) when a bundle took in a file from outside its
// part: that is the boundary between parts, since a part cannot ship another part's code.
//
//   install src/main.mts -> install/dist/anywherellm-suite.cjs, the command people run, for Node
//           18. The extension is fixed (.cjs) so it runs the same wherever it is copied to. What
//           install puts into AnythingLLM's storage, every skill, built first, is inlined as
//           PAYLOAD. Allowed: src/ and shared/.
//   skills  each skill's src/handler.ts -> <skill>/build/<hubId>/handler.js plus plugin.json, the
//           folder AnythingLLM unpacks, for Node 18. esbuild folds src/ and shared/ (helpers both
//           parts use) into the one handler.js, which then requires only Node's own modules (and
//           AnythingLLM's, by a path built at run time). Allowed: the skill's src/ and shared/,
//           and the packages VENDORED names for it, less the modules STUBBED names. A skill's
//           static/ folder (guides, pages, snippets: what is tuned rather than coded) is inlined
//           as text, as STATIC_FILES ({ "guide/index.md": "...", ... }), so the skill still ships
//           two files, which the Hub's upload and install's text payload both need. The VENDORED
//           packages' versions are inlined as VENDORED_VERSIONS ("puppeteer-core@24.43.1 ws@8.22.0
//           ..."), for the per-process keys that keep a reloaded skill off an older copy.
//
// usage: node build.mjs [install | skills [skill ...]]   (no argument: every part)
