# The browser's tab, for clients

What the browser skill (`packages/skills/browser`, hubId `browser-lean`) publishes about a chat's tab, so a client such as AnywhereLLM Lite can show its own cards for it: a request for a login or a code, the answer sent, and the chat going on once it's typed. The stock AnythingLLM chat shows none of this; it renders the agent's Markdown, whose card opens the tab's page.

`tests/page.test.mts` checks the state's fields below against what the skill writes. A change to anything here is made in the skill and this file together.

## The card in the agent's reply

An answer about the tab ends with its card, as Markdown:

```text
[![<name>](<base>/browser-lean/<token>-card.jpg?v=<stamp>)](<base>/browser-lean/<token>.html)

**<name>** · <host>
```

- `<base>` is the skill's `ANYTHINGLLM_URL` setting, or empty (links from AnythingLLM's own root).
- `<token>` names the chat's tab: it stays the same for the tab's life, and a new tab gets a new one. It's a capability: whoever has it can read the tab's state and post to its page.
- `<name>` and `<host>` hold no brackets or line breaks. A reply without a picture has the last line alone.

A client finds the card by the link `…/browser-lean/<token>.html` and reads the files beside it, all served by AnythingLLM's public folder with no sign-in.

| File | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `<token>.html` | the tab's page (the skill's `static/pages/tab.html`) |
| `<token>.json` | the tab's state (below), written after each step and each change from the page |
| `<token>.jpg` | the tab's picture |
| `<token>-card.jpg` | the card's crop of it |

Read `<token>.json` with a query that changes (`?t=<now>`) or no cache: it's rewritten in place.

## The state, `<token>.json`

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `title` | string | the page's title, at most 200 characters |
| `url` | string | the tab's address, at most 2000 characters |
| `host` | string | its host |
| `mine` | boolean | whether it's a tab the user opened themselves (below), which is always theirs and has no bar saying who holds it |
| `tabs` | array | the workspace's tabs, for the strip along the top of the page: each chat's, then the user's own, each `{path, title, host, mine, agent, here, made}`: `path` is its page beside this one (`<token>.html`), `agent` says the agent has it (a chat's tab the user doesn't hold), `here` marks this tab, and `made` is the id the page that asked for a tab of the user's own gave (null for a chat's) |
| `sites` | array of strings | the sites a new tab's home lists: the ones with a saved login first, then the open tabs' hosts |
| `back` | boolean | whether the tab can go back (true where the page can't say) |
| `forward` | boolean | whether it can go forward |
| `shot` | number | when the state and picture were written, ms since 1970 |
| `until` | number | when the tab's browser closes unless the agent or the user does a step first, ms since 1970 by AnythingLLM's clock (its `Date` header): the workspace's one browser, so every tab of the workspace has the same, and a step in any of its chats moves it. A tab past its `until` is closed, though its state may not say so: a restart of AnythingLLM closes its tabs without writing `closed` |
| `size` | `{w, h}` | the tab's screen, in CSS pixels |
| `who` | `"agent"` or `"user"` | who holds the tab (`user`: taken over on its page) |
| `fields` | array | the fields in view, only while the user holds the tab |
| `need` | object or null | what the agent asked the user to enter (below) |
| `offer` | object or null | a login or passkey the page offers to save: `{kind, site, user}` |
| `msg` | `{text, id}` or null | a line for the page to show once ("Saved for example.com"; a login the site seems to have refused). It stays in the state for up to a minute, so show each `id` once |
| `vault` | string or null | the path of the Vault on this host (`/vault-lean/<token>.html`), where the saved logins and passkeys are listed and deleted; null where it couldn't be written, or when the links to the Library page and the Vault are kept from the agent (the tab's page then shows no Vault button) |

A closed tab's state is `{"closed": true}`, and its other files are gone. The open tabs of every chat (a scheduled job's aren't) are listed in the links file for the bridge, which passes them on (`browser` in [page-links.md](page-links.md)), so a client finds the tabs of chats it hasn't read too.

### `need`

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `kind` | `"login"` or `"code"` | a login (username and password) or a one-time code |
| `host` | string | the site it's for; it's typed only while the tab is still on it |
| `text` | string | the line under the form's title, in the skill's own words, never the model's: empty for a login (the title says it: "Sign in to `<host>`", or "Choose a password for `<host>`" for a new account), `For <host>.` for a code, and `It may not have been accepted. Enter it again.` for a request asked again |
| `label` | string or null | for a code: "The verification code", "The code from your authenticator app", "The code sent to your phone" or "The code sent to your email" |
| `hasUser` | boolean | for a login: whether a username is asked for too |
| `confirm` | boolean | for a login: a new account's password, which the user chooses; it's typed into the "Confirm password" field too |
| `until` | number | when the request lapses, ms since 1970 (10 minutes after it was made) |

`need` goes back to null once the answer is typed, the user cancels, or it lapses. When the form can't be sent yet because it needs something else first (a CAPTCHA, say), the answer is typed but not submitted, and `msg` says what's still needed. When the site still shows the same field after an answer was submitted (a login or code it likely refused), the request is made again with a `text` that says so.

## Answering, as the page does

The page's settings are in `<token>.html`, on the line `const cfg = {…};`: `token`, `secret`, `title` (`"browser-lean-event"`), `workspace`, `tab`, `key` (the page's upload key) and `pub` (the vault's public key, SPKI, base64). A client that answers reads them there.

An event is posted to AnythingLLM's browser-extension upload, as a document whose text is the event's JSON:

```http
POST <base>/api/browser-extension/upload-content
Authorization: Bearer <cfg.key>
Content-Type: application/json

{"textContent": "<the event, as JSON text>", "metadata": {"title": "browser-lean-event", "docSource": "browser-lean page"}}
```

Every event carries `{"browser_lean_event": 1, "workspace": cfg.workspace, "tab": cfg.tab, "secret": cfg.secret, "ev": "<kind>", "t": "<ISO time>"}` and its own fields. One without the tab's `secret` is dropped.

| `ev` | Fields | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `need-answer` | login: `user` (when `hasUser`), `sealed` (the password, sealed), `save` (true: save the login once signed in); code: `text` | types it into the tab, and clicks the request's submit button if the agent named one |
| `need-cancel` | `reason`: `"later"` or `"takeover"` | drops the request; the agent is told the user chose not to, or is taking the tab over |

**Sealing a password:** RSA-OAEP with SHA-256 under `cfg.pub`, base64. A value longer than 190 bytes is sealed as `h1.<key>.<iv>.<value>`: the value with a new AES-256-GCM key (its 16-byte tag last), and that key with RSA-OAEP, each part base64. The skill opens it with the vault's private key; AnythingLLM's documents hold only the sealed text. A code is sent as it is.

The page's other events (`take`, `give`, `tap`, `scroll`, `type`, `nav` with `do` back, forward or reload, `size`, `offer`) are its takeover and its offer to save a login, and `new` (`q`, a search or an address, and `made`, an id to find the tab by along `tabs`) and `close` open a tab of the user's own and close a tab; they're not part of this contract yet.

## The user's own tabs

From a tab's page the user can open tabs of their own: its + and More › New tab show a new tab's home, where a search or an address (`new`) opens one. Such a tab's key is `you-<n>`, a name no chat's thread has, and it's kept apart from the chats' tabs: in a browser context of its own (its cookies aren't the chats'), in a map the agent's actions never look in, with nothing done in it noted for the agent, and under a token no answer of the agent's carries. Its state has `mine` true and `who` always `"user"`, and never a `need`. It goes through the fence as a chat's tab does; an address the fence refuses is said on the page that asked (`msg`), and noted for the Vault to offer under Allowed addresses.

## When an answer lands

The skill applies a page's events within a second or two while it watches (for 30 minutes after it last drew the tab's card), and otherwise at the agent's next call. Once an answer is typed, the state is written again with `need` null. The agent isn't woken: it learns what happened at its next call, as a note in its read of the tab. So a client that wants the chat to go on sends a message of its own once `need` is null and `shot` is later than its answer (for example "Done: I entered it on the tab's page").
